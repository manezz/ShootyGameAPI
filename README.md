Project Overview

This repository contains my part of the final apprenticeship project, which is the API for a game developed by my project partner.

The API serves as the backend for handling core game functionality such as player data management, friend systems, scoring, and more. It’s built to integrate seamlessly with the game client, ensuring smooth communication between the player’s actions and the game’s data.
